A statement of purpose is a documented essay that summarises your educational background, professional pursuits and is
submitted to the admission committee of the university of your choice. This document consists of your career goals and
gives you the chance to justify your interest in the particular course. An SOP is an ideal document where the applicant
must mention the reason behind choosing this particular university and how the program aligns with the applicant’s
aspirations.

It is a pivotal part of the application process and we at Abroad Assist are here to get you started. In this blog post,
we will discuss how to write a statement of purpose with the help of a detailed step-by-step process and example.

**_Welcome aboard!_**

## How is an SOP drafted?

If you waver on the decision of which direction to take, take the time to brainstorm and do extensive research. What
subjects interest you? Is there a particular job role you would like to have, or a particular prospect you are after? In
order to enhance your education and skill set, it is recommended that you focus and deliberate on a specific industry or
field that you are passionate about.

An SOP should ideally outline your interests, academic qualification and your aspirations. It should be a reflection of
your personality and highlight your strengths. Mentioning your career goals and being honest with your decisions will
help you write an original, unique essay. Once you have picked an industry such as Engineering, Business administration
or Management, pick your course. You can choose the right course for yourself based on the following factors:

- Curriculum - the strength of difficulty,
- Subjects the program entails
- Duration of the program and
- Type/qualification (master’s degree, diploma, certificate course)

## How to write an authentic SOP

When ideating about writing an SOP, it is important to keep in mind that there are several features that students are
expected to include. Your background is important to us and the committee would like to know more about how it has
shaped your interest in this course. Please include any inspirational sources, mentors, or instances that have
influenced your decision.

**Construct**: Follow a linear structure. Start with your academic background, mention why you pursue your undergraduate
degree and include extracurriculars, if any. The admission committee receives multiple SOPs, so remember to avoid
repetition and conclude with a separate paragraph to maintain the flow of the reader. Please create a document that is
both concise and meaningful, while also including all necessary and relevant information.

**Revise**: Make it presentable. There is no need to include colours and borders as it does not affect the content. The
key to producing a consistent SOP is to maintain the same font size throughout and to avoid making any grammar mistakes.
After you have carefully proofread it and are content with the final product, then you can consider it complete.

_**Bonus tip**: Steer clear of copying content from references, it is imperative that the SOP is personal and
plagiarism-free._
