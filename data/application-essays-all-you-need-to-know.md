## What are application essays?

Application essays are usually a set of questions the applicant has to answer. This is then evaluated and dictates
whether or not the applicant secures admission. Application essays are a common requirement and popular among several
industries, ranging from STEM courses, business, medical and dental schools.

These are usually a set of questions that assess your qualifications, career goals and are a testament of your academic
background as a whole. The questions and the number of questions, too vary with course and industry along with the
length and detail in answers. They are generally accessible on the university’s official website portal.

Application essays also give you an ideal opportunity to justify your calibre and passion for the field with relevant
examples. Including academic accolades while necessary andi integrating soft skills into your essays often has a
positive impact. This means the admissions committee will get a gist of your personality and it is important to
prioritise authenticity.

## Why are they important?

Application questions holistically assess your skills, work experience and qualifications. Often, most of the questions
are directed towards your reason for choosing the particular program or univeristy. It is important to present thought
through answers after much deliberation and research.

Universities that don’t accept a statement of purpose or motivation letter, often substitute with application essays.
They are far more descriptive and give separate insights into the candidate’s aspirations, previous CGPAs and
achievements. This makes application questions slightly more challenging than a single statement of purpose and thus
carry weight.

## Pointers to include in application essays

As subjective as these questions are, the general line of questioning is focussed on the program you are applying for,
the university and possibly the county. These questions require you to justify your decision to advance your higher
education and how your future goal might benefit the university and its alumni.

**Here are a few key points to keep in mind while answering your application essays/questions**:

#### Program & industry

Before proceeding, check prospective job roles or future work opportunities for your program. Are you interested in this
industry? If you don't see a sustainable means to proceed, rethink. Multiple questions with regards to the program,
major subjects and passion for the field are bound to arise, so if you want to tap out and try something else out, now
is your chance.

Highlight features of the programme that interested you. Mention faculty names and research opportunities the university
offers if that is enticing to you. These unique pointers will make your application stand out. Research before you
write.

#### Word limit

Each question generally has a different word limit. Read the instructions thoroughly before answering your questions. Be
cautious of whether the university mentioned the limit in words or characters. (There is a difference!)

#### Writing style

Use formal language and cite relevant project experiences, job roles and internships opportunities sthat enhanced your
learning process. Refrain from using unnecessary vocabulary and surpassing the word limit.

#### Format

Ensure you have a meaningful answer and all the points are in continuity. The admissions committee dislikes irrelevant
and verbose answers. Pick an ideal font size, leave a margin and proofread you document for grammar and spelling errors.
Above all, ensure your response answers the question at hand.
